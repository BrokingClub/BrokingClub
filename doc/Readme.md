We will document our whole project with .md (markdown) files on github for versioning reasons. Markdown files are easy versions of html files. Styling and complex layouts are not that important, because the content and version controlling counts in a good documentation.

Please check out our self created markdown formatter, where you can take a look at all the written documents we produced:

Our version controlling is visible at the link below:
